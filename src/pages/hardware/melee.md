# Melee

Close-range, heavy-damage weapon that grants the ability to charge.

Charging will close a one-tile gap between you and your target, but only if the target is two tiles away in a cardinal direction (i.e. you can't charge right in order to hit an enemy above you).

| Tier | Damage | Charge cooldown |

| 3 | 550 | 4 |
